# Plantosphere
 Plantosphere is a smart plant care platform that uses machine learning to identify plants from images and provide care tips like watering, sunlight needs, and disease detection. It helps users—especially gardeners and plant lovers—take better care of their plants through an easy-to-use, tech-driven system.

Plantosphere is my final year project focused on developing a smart and user-friendly plant care platform. It uses machine learning and image processing to identify plants through photos uploaded by users. Once identified, the system provides detailed information about the plant, including its name, care tips, watering needs, sunlight requirements, and common diseases. The goal is to help users—especially plant lovers, gardeners, and beginners—take better care of their plants using technology. The project also includes features like plant disease detection and regular care reminders. Plantosphere combines technology with environmental awareness to promote healthy and easy plant care for everyone.
